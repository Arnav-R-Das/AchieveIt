Hey! <br>
When it comes to task managment, I just love using good ol' pen-n-paper. <br>
But facing certain issues prompted me to put recreate my task managemnt system into a web app.

#

### ADD
- **QUICKLY ADD** tasks <br>
  Minimal use of the mouse, because typing is faster
- Add **DEADLINES**
- **SCHEDULE** tasks
- WIP: Add **SUB-TASKS**
  - Breakdown bigger tasks into smaller chunks
  - Reduce friction

#

### REVIEW
- **ALL TASKS**
  - Easily view your entire workload at a glance
  - No need to keep track of multiple lists at different places
- WIP: **UPCOMING** <br>
  View upcoming deadlines and tasks scheduled for each:
  - Day
  - Week
  - or Month

#

### EDIT / UPDATE

#

### PRIORITIZE
- **EISENHOWER MATRIX**
  - Tasks are **AUTOMATICALLY SORTED** into quadrants based on their Urgency (Deadline) and Importance
  - Declutters overwhleming amounts of workload
  - Quickly prioritizes all tasks
- WIP: **REORDER** tasks
  - Use **AUTOMATIC PRIORITIZOR** to reorder all tasks in ascending order of their deadline / schedule
  - Or **MANUALLY** reorder tasks in desired order

#

### SHORTLIST
- Choose MITs for the day <br>
  Transfer them from All Tasks to Today's tasks
- Reduces the feeling of overwhelm
- Helps to focus

#

### ARCHIVE

#

### DELETE

#

### OTHER
- **DARK MODE**
